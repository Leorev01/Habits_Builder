# How to Contribute

Depending on your workflow, you can contribute in one of three ways:

## 1. Contributing via Bash (Terminal)

  Fork the repository on GitHub (via website)
  
```bash
# Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

# Create a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b branch-name

# Make changes to code or files

# Add changed files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push the branch to your fork
git push origin branch-name
```

  Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from this branch

## 2. Contributing via GitHub Website

  1. Open the repository you want to contribute to.

  2. Click the Fork button in the top-right corner to create your copy of the repository.

  3. In your fork, find the file you want to edit.

  4. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit the file directly on the site.

  5. Make the necessary changes.

  6. Scroll down to the Commit changes section at the bottom.

  7. Write a short description of your changes and click Commit changes.

  8. GitHub will then offer you to create a Pull Request — click Compare & pull request.

  9. Describe your changes and submit the Pull Request for review

## 3. Contributing via GitHub Desktop

  1. Fork the repository via the GitHub website.

  2. Open GitHub Desktop.

  3. Clone your fork using GitHub Desktop.

  4. Create a new branch in GitHub Desktop (Branch > New Branch).

  5. Open the project in your preferred editor and make changes.

  6. Switch back to GitHub Desktop and enter a commit message at the bottom.

  7. Click Commit to [branch].

  8. Click Push origin to upload changes to your fork.

  9. In GitHub Desktop, click Create Pull Request — this will open the GitHub page for PR creation.

  10. Describe your changes and submit the Pull Request.
